# AI-Powered Sentiment Analyzer for African SMEs 📊🤖

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can support **UN Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** by empowering **Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)** in Africa to understand customer sentiment.

We use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Supervised Machine Learning** to classify customer reviews as positive or negative, helping businesses make informed financial and product decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for stretch goals)
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- NLTK for text cleaning

---

## 📦 Dataset

- Dataset: `SME-Training.csv` *(uploaded manually)*
- Contains labeled customer feedback used to train and test sentiment prediction models.

---

## 🚀 How it Works

1. **Text Cleaning**: Remove noise (punctuation, URLs, emojis).
2. **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopwords removal, lowercasing.
3. **Vectorization**: Convert text to numerical vectors (TF-IDF).
4. **Modeling**:
   - Naive Bayes Classifier (Scikit-learn)
   - Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
   - Visualizations

---

## 📈 Results

- Naive Bayes Accuracy: ~82%
- TensorFlow Neural Network Accuracy: ~86%
- Visuals: Confusion matrix, sentiment distribution

## 🔍 Ethical Considerations

- Biased data may misrepresent informal language or slang common in African regions.
- Responsible AI deployment ensures that SME feedback analytics promote **fairness**, **accessibility**, and **growth**
